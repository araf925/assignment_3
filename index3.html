	<b>St Martin's is a tropical cliché and the only coral island in Bangladesh, with beaches fringed with coconut palms and laid-back locals. It's a clean and peaceful place with nothing more strenuous to do than soak up the rays — even mosquitoes are a rarity. There's a naval base near the centre of the island, and the USA looked into setting up one of their own a few years back. The island was devastated by a cyclone in 1991 but has fully recovered, and was untouched by the 2004 tsunami.<b></p>


<p class="oo1">It is possible to walk around St Martin's in a day since it measures only 8 km², shrinking to about 5 km² during high tide. Most of the island's 7000 inhabitants live primarily from fishing, and between October and April, fishermen from neighbouring areas bring their catch to the island's temporary wholesale market also most of the tourists visit this place mostly in winter. Rice and coconuts are the other 
staple crops, and algae are collected and dried from the sea rocks and sold for consumption to Myanmar.</p>

<p class="oo1">Most things are concentrated around the far north of the island, with the centre and south being mostly farmland and makeshift huts. There is no electricity on the island, though the larger hotels run generators in the evenings for a few hours.</p>

<p class="oo1">November to February is the main tourist season with the best weather, though keep an eye on the forecast, as the occasional cyclone can strike during this time.

		Getting to Saint Martins Island by bus is a two-step process. First you'll need to travel to Teknaf which is the Southern most district of Bangladesh on the very southern tip, sandwiched up against Myanmar. One can come to Teknaf by bus from Dhaka, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. Dhaka to Teknaf bus fare is around BDT 850-900 non-A/C and BDT 1400-1700 A/C as of January, 2012. There are several bus services which depart from Fakirapool, Dhaka to Teknaf. Maximum bus starts at night and the journey is near about 10-11 hours. From Teknaf, mid-level ships run daily and take around 2-2.30 hours named Kutubdia, Keary Sindabad, Eagle-1. The fare starts from BDT 450 to BDT 2500 as of September, 2012. All the ships and cruises stars journey from Teknaf to Saint Martin around 9AM-9.30AM and return journey starts from Saint Martin to around 3PM. The important thing is, during the off-season (May-August/September)these ships do not provide services because off bad weather. The peak season is September-April. The total distance from Dhaka to the island is 510 km.
